KPS Interview plugin is a powerful, professional developer sample example
to create plugin with custom types, fields and columns with bulk import for WordPress.

== Description ==

I was given following task, which is mentioned bellow.

WordPress Task for GKB Labs Interview

Create a plugin with the following features

Admin section
a) Add an option in settings menu called demo-plugin with submenu options

1.  create user 2) import users 3) list users

Create-users page:

First Name (Text Box)

Last Name (Text Box)

Email (Text Box)

Hobbies (checkbox) with option TV, Reading, coding, skiing

Gender (Radio) with options Male, Female

Upload picture (add WordPress media upload option )

Submit and Cancel buttons

Upon Submit save data into Database

3. Import users:

Provide an option to import users data from a CSV (CSV will contain above fields, first name or last name and email are mandatory )

Upon import CSV, report (display on the screen) how many were successfully imported and how many were failed

4. List Users:
   List all users with pagination
   Provider options to edit, delete

5)  Upload code into GitHub and share the link ( you may create an account if you don’t have one )

6. Find out a free hosting and upload your code as a demo (very helpful for evaluating the task )

Most importantly, plugin should follow all WordPress coding standards, and it should be export as zip and import as a plugin in other WordPress sites. The plugin should contain the SQL file required to store the user’s data and auto-execute SQL when plugin activated.

#### It's developer-friendly

As a developer, you have enough on your plate. You shouldn't have to create an entirely new system for each project. Use KPS Interview to your full advantage.

You can use KPS Interview and its custom fields in WordPress on as many websites as you want so you can use it on client projects as well.
